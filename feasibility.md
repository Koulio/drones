This section studies the feasibility of the proposal.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study
a feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success.
A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the environment.
This is abbreviated as SWOT.
In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are <strong>cost</strong> required and <strong>value</strong> to be attained.

There are two points of view:

  * The self-interest of individual team members developing the solution
  * The venture (team) as a whole developing the solution

### Strengths
### Weaknesses
### Opportunities
### Threats
