This section studies the feasibility of the proposal.

TODO: Update the sample above with criteria and ratings relevant to this project.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study
a feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success.
A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the environment.
This is abbreviated as SWOT.
In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are <strong>cost</strong> required and <strong>value</strong> to be attained.

There are several points of view:

  0. <a href="#TeamMembers">The self-interest of individual team members developing the solution</a>
  0. <a href="#Venture">The venture (team) as a whole developing the solution</a>
  0. <a href="#Users">The organizations involved in search and rescue (users of the system)</a>
  0. <a href="#DJI">DJI</a>

<a name="TeamMembers">
## 1. Individual Team members</a>

Each individual on the team would have success criteria such as:

   * Skill building to leverage on future projects
   * Fun from working with leading-edge equipment
   * Sense of accomplishment overcoming difficulty
   * Fun working with colleagues
   * Inclusiveness

<a name="Venture">
## 2. Venture</a>

For the team as a whole would have success criteria such as:

   * Achieving the maximum number of points during the challenge event.
   * A quick way for team members to get each other's attention (Slack channel)
   * An effective mechanism for creating the proposal document and intermediate notes (Github)
   * Team members collaborating effectively
   * Team members filling in for each other

<a name="Users">
## 3. System Users</a>

Those using the system after the challenge would have success criteria such as:

   * Precision in finding survivors
   * Ease of use
   * Archival of media created during flights
   * Durability of the system
   * Reusability of systems to live subjects (actual survivors)
   * Expandability (to use more drones in the future)

Even though these are largely irrelevant for the purpose of the Challenge,
the team will keep them in mind because of individual interests in leveraging this work to future projects.

<a name="DJI">
## 4. DJI</a>

The company sponsoring the challenge would have these success criteria:

   * Increased capability in products
   * Publicity which generates additional sales
   * Provide a venue for enthusiasts to meet and work with each other.

### Strengths
* Experience

### Weaknesses
* Funding
* Lack of experience with new some new software

### Opportunities

### Threats
Several apps have already been created to stream the live video feed, control the camera, take snapshots, record video, change location mid-flight, return the drone and land it at a designated spot, etc.:
