   SUGGESTION: Keep consistent with the most popular existing apps (Spotify, Accuweather):

   ![dji ford sync3accuweather](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12869696/54fb4882-ccdb-11e5-999c-d838c09b6e52.jpg)

   Notice the app's buttons are aligned from left to right for ease of reach by drivers seated on the left side of the car.

   SUGGESTION: Center align the buttons so drivers on either side can feel comfortable with the screen.

   Notice the large size of the buttons (___ x ___ pixels) so they are easy to reach by drivers concentrating on the road.

   Notice there are graphic icons within each button so users are not totally reliant on reading and understanding the English words.
