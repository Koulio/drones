## Hardware Components:
* Android mobile smartphone
* F150 SYNC hardware

* DJI’s Matrice 100 (M100) flying platform, 
* DJI’s Guidance SDK
* DJI’s Onboard SDK

The M100 has a 40 minute fly time.

### Supplies and Tooling
* Battery tester
* Extra Battery
* Battery chargers
* Replacements for damage (propellers, etc.)


## Hardware Strategies
"Mission timer stops when the M100 motors switch off.” so ideally the drone would power itself off.
