## No-fly Zones

Drones are programmed by DJI to not take off near safety zones within:

* 330 feet of 1.5 miles from the 5 mile (8 km) radius around Category A sites (international airports).
* .06 mile of the .06 mile (1 km) around Category B smaller airports.

Waypoints cannot be set within 8 km of safety zones.

The default height limit is 1300 feet with a GPS signal or 398 feet without a GPS signal.
