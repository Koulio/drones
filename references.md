How high is 164 feet? Watch a high dive: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEiwAAHakI0

QUESTION: How is the 50 x 50m delimited? With GPS coordinates but also recognizable visible physical boundaries too?

QUESTION: How is the home base for the drone delimited?

QUESTION: For the challenge, are we limited to the example scenario in the rules doc? What type of terrain should the search and rescue be involved in/limited to? e.g. If we restrict the drones in no-fly zones, is it not permitted for search and rescue in those areas?

QUESTION: (Possibly answered somwhere?) Is the route of the target/home vehicle determinate? Are there any objects moving within the rescue zone? Are the survivors stationary?

## No-fly Zones

Drones are programmed by DJI to not take off near safety zones within:

* 330 feet of 1.5 miles from the 5 mile (8 km) radius around Category A sites (international airports).
* .06 mile of the .06 mile (1 km) around Category B smaller airports.

Waypoints cannot be set within 8 km of safety zones.

The default height limit is 1300 feet with a GPS signal or 398 feet without a GPS signal.
