QUESTION: (Possibly answered somwhere?) Is the route of the target/home vehicle determinate? Are there any objects moving within the rescue zone? Are the survivors stationary?

Drones are programmed by DJI to not take off near safety zones within:

* 330 feet of 1.5 miles from the 5 mile (8 km) radius around Category A sites (international airports).
* .06 mile of the .06 mile (1 km) around Category B smaller airports.

Waypoints cannot be set within 8 km of safety zones.

The default height limit is 1300 feet with a GPS signal or 398 feet without a GPS signal.

  HiveMapper.com is creating a 3D map of the world containing no-fly zones
  by allowing others to update their database.
