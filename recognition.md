This article describes now AprilTags are recognized by software.

## Identify range of effectivity

For repeatability and comparability:
   * Use a string and weight from the camera to make positioning repeatable
   * Mark position and stength of light source to position the same way each time.
   * Measure light strengh with a hand-held light meter.

Effectiveness of image recognition is measured in percentage of 100. ???

TEST STRATEGY A: Design AprilTags of different sizes on a 8.5x11 page.
Take a picture of the target at different feet lengths away from the target.

TEST STRATEGY B: Repeat the test using different light levels.

TEST STRATEGY C: Position AprilTags at <strong>different angles</strong>.
0 degrees is flat to the camera.

| Strategy | Light | Feet | Angle | Description | Effectiveness |
| -------- |-----: |----: | ----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| A | 5000 |   10 |   0 | Closest |  99 |
| A | 5000 | 1000 |   0 | Farthest | 15 |
